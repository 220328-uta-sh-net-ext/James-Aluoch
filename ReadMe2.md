# some of  the most crucial tools used in a continuous deployment workflow:
**Version control**  Version control helps with continuous integration by tracking revisions to a particular project’s assets. Also known as “revision" or “source” control, version control helps to improve visibility of a project's updates and changes while helping teams collaborate regardless of where and when they work.
**Code review:** As simple as it sounds, “code review” is a process of using tools to test the current source code. Code reviews help improve the integrity of software by finding bugs and errors in coding and help developers address these issues before deploying updates.
**Continuous integration (CI):** CI is a critical component of continuous deployment and plays a major part in minimizing development roadblocks when multiple developers work on the same project. A variety of proprietary and open source CI tools exist, each catering to the unique complexities of enterprise software deployments.
**Configuration management** Configuration management is the strategy and discipline of making sure all software and hardware maintain a consistent state. This includes proper configuration and automation of all servers, storage, networking, and software.
**Release automation:** Application release automation (or application release orchestration) is very important when automating all of the activities necessary to drive continuous deployment. Orchestration tools connect processes to one another to ensure developers follow all necessary steps before pushing new changes to production. These tools work closely with configuration management processes to ensure that all project environments are properly provisioned and able to perform at their highest level.
**Infrastructure monitoring:** When operating a continuous deployment model, it’s important to be able to visualize the data that lives in your testing environments. Infrastructure monitoring tools help you analyze application performance to see if changes you make have a positive or negative impact.
## Working with Kubernetes
## What are Kubernetes?
-  Kubernetes is a great open source solution to use when developing a continuous deployment pipeline. 
## Why use Kubernetes?
- 1.Because of its flexible, 
-  2.logical, 
-  3. intuitive user interface
-  4. Kubernetes makes it possible to reduce the common problems that arise when running into server usage restrictions and outages while supporting modern infrastructure and multicloud deployments.
-  5. Kubernetes helps increase the agility of DevOps processes. Because of its modular design, Kubernetes allows alteration of individual pods inside a service, as well as seamless transitions between pods. This flexibility helps development teams avoid server downtime and allows for maximum resource utilization when running microservices. 
-  6. Kubernetes is also an extremely reliable platform that can detect the readiness and overall health of applications and services before they’re deployed to the public.
**Continuous deployment across diverse applications**
-	When creating continuous delivery or continuous deployment infrastructure, it’s important to source the right enterprise solution that will give your business the confidence it needs to automate software testing and deployment processes. IBM UrbanCode Deploy is an application deployment automation platform that provides the visibility, traceability, and auditing capabilities businesses need to drive their software development needs in one optimized package.
**Multicloud deployments**
- Using UrbanCode Deploy’s Easy Process and Blueprint Designer- organizations can create custom cloud environment models to visualize how their applications should be deployed to public, private, and hybrid cloud. 
-	Blueprint Designer allows users to create, update, and break down full-stack computing environments while enabling full cloud orchestration capabilities. All environments can then be provisioned to deploy application components automatically or on demand.
**Distributed automation**
-	UrbanCode Deploy is a highly scalable solution that supports the dynamic deployment of all mission-critical applications and services. Architected to meet the unique requirements of enterprises deploying across multiple data centers.
-	UrbanCode Deploy supports master server clustering and uses lightweight deployments to provide immediate availability of services.
**Quality gates and approvals**
- Being able to rely on the accuracy of automated testing environments is absolutely critical to successfully achieving continuous deployment. For some environments, however, it’s necessary to create certain conditions that flag manual approvals to ensure that the right information is pushed to production at the right time. UrbanCode Deploy features deployment approvals and gates to give administrators more control, visibility, and auditing capabilities over their continuous deployment processes.
**Tested integrations**
-	While UrbanCode Deploy supports the use of your own scripts, out-of-the-box plugins make deployment processes easier to design and manage. By using tested integrations, developers can utilize pre-built automation that has already been proven. This replaces the need to create custom scripts specifically for UrbanCode Deploy.
-	IBM UrbanCode Deploy features advanced process orchestration and collaboration tools that make it possible for enterprises to organize all of their deployment needs in one easy-to-use, customizable dashboard. Whether deploying applications on-premise, off-premise, or across thousands of managed servers, UrbanCode Deploy gives you all the solutions you need to ensure continuous delivery and rapid deployment across your entire enterprise.

**Continuous deployment and IBM Cloud**
- The ability to release code changes automatically into the production environment can help dramatically speed time to market-You can do this with IBM tools as well as integrations with third parties and open source plugins. IBM processes and tools can help you with one of the most challenging DevOps initiatives organizations face—building and modernizing applications on the journey to cloud.
